# Problem Description
***This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers default paYments in Taiwan. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. We can use the K-S chart to evaluate which customers will default on their credit card payments***
* **Objective of our project is to predict which customer might default in upcoming months. Before going any further let's have a quick look on defination of what actually meant by Credit Card Default.** 


* **We are all aware what is credit card. It is type of payment payment card in which charges are made against a line of credit instead of the account holder's cash deposits. When someone uses a credit card to make a purchase, that person's account accrues a balance that must be paid off each month.**

* **Credit card default happens when you have become severely delinquent on your credit card payments.Missing credit card payments once or twice does not count as a default. A payment default occurs when you fail to pay the Minimum Amount Due on the credit card for a few consecutive months.**

* **So now we know what a credit card is. Now let's see one of problems faced by companies who provide credit cards. Yes it is the peolpe who do not clear off the credit card debt aka credit card defaulters**.

* ***The research aims at developing a mechanism to predict the credit card default beforehand and to identify the potential customer base that can be offered various credit instruments so as to invite minimum default.***
